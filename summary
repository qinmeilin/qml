##Summary
 I tested the QQ mailbox, Gmail mailbox, 163 mailbox, Yahoo mailbox, Sohu mailbox, Sina mailbox and hotmail mailbox.By testing, master can send control commands to these mail servers, and bot can accept the message and execute the commands.The mailbox received three emails, respectively is "gcat", "checkin" and "imp" .  
 Firstly,the request was refused when I tried to send an email to Gmail mailbox,Yahoo mailbox and 163 mailbox through the client.Because the mailbox server thought it was an insecure login and prevented it, and only when I changed the security settings could I send an email to mailbox through the client.  
 Among them, when logging into the QQ mailbox every time, you need to send a message to configure the mail client, thereby the mailbox will generate third party client authorization code,  and  then you can login to the QQ mail server through this authorization code .Similarly, you need to set up a client password when you first log on to the 163 mailbox.  
 Send email code:  
 '''  
 msg = MIMEMultipart()  
 msg['From'] = sub_header  
 msg['To'] = username  
 msg['Subject'] = sub_header  
 msgtext = json.dumps({'cmd': cmd, 'arg': arg})  
 msg.attach(MIMEText(str(msgtext)))  
 '''  
 Connect to server via SMTP 
 '''  
 smtp = smtplib.SMTP()  
 smtp.connect(smtpserver,port)  
 smtp.ehlo()  
 smtp.starttls()  
 smtp.set_debuglevel(1)  
 smtp.login(username, password)  
 smtp.sendmail(sender, receiver, msg.as_string())  
 smtp.quit()  
 '''  
 Receive email code  
 '''    
 c = imaplib.IMAP4("imap.xxx.com",port)  
 c.login("userName","password")  
 c.logout()  
 '''  
 '''  
 c = poplib.POP3("pop3.xxx.com",port)  
 c.user(user)  
 c.pass_(pwd)  
 c.quit()  
 '''  
 Sina mailbox and sohu mailbox  receive mail using the POP protocol,while others using IMAP protocol.
